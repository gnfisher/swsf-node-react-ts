# Full Stack TypeScript: Express, React, and Typescript

This is my hobby project where I will be [Learning In
Public][swyx-learn-public] about full-stack Typescript applications! The goal is
to build a forum-like software for an online, text-based RPG I am involved with
using an Express-powered API, React as the client, and Typescript. Specifically,
I'm curious to learn:

- What's it like working in Typescript, and how much of what I love about
  Scala and Elm can I replicate in TS?
- What's involved in putting a project together? Coming from Rails, I'm pretty
  spoiled and lazy.
- Using API types for the expected response/request for an endpoint like the
  [example in this video][gary-video-types] from [Gary
  Bernhardt](https://twitter.com/garybernhardt).
- How fast can I work? Taking into account all the initial onboarding and
  learning, can I see myself being productive with this stack in the future?

## The Stack and libraries I'd like to use ðŸ“š

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) for the API server.
- [React](https://reactjs.org) for the client.
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) for the database.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for the types!
- [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts) for typing the API.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling the front end.
