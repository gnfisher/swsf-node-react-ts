# Express, React, and Typescript sittin' in a tree

This is my hobby project where I will be [Learning In
Public][swyx-learn-public] about full-stack Typescript applications! The goal is
to build a forum-like software for an online, text-based RPG I am involved with
using an Express-powered API, React as the client, and Typescript. Specifically,
I'm curious to learn:

  * What's it like working in Typescript, and how much of what I love about
    Scala and Elm can I replicate in TS?
  * What's involved in putting a project together? Coming from Rails, I'm pretty
    spoiled and lazy...
  * Using API types for the expected response/request for an endpoint like the
    [example in this video][gary-video-types] from [Gary
    Bernhardt](https://twitter.com/garybernhardt).

## ðŸ’ª ðŸ“– ðŸ•¶ Motivation

I've been working on a project at [thoughtbot][tb] for the
last year that uses a Scala server and an Elm frontend. It's been a lot of fun
but it is a difficult tech stack to onboard folks into. After watching the
[video from Gary I mentioned above][gary-video-types] and reading about
[io-ts][io-ts] I got excited about recreating some of the DX of the Scala/Elm
project in a full stack Typescript setup.

Will it be as nice? Is it even *possible*?

I want to find out!
